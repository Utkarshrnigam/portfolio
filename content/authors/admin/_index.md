I am currently a BTech student pursuing Information Technology at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology,Noida.

I have made some interesting projects on Deep learning like facial recognition, image captioning etc, I have also tried to solve some kaggle challenges on my own.

In the same I am working on some more cool projects.
